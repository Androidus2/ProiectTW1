                Who are we?
            </h1>
            <p>We are an indie game company from Romania. It has originally started just for fun and ended up as an ambitious project. It is a side activity, so we can't really dedicate ourselves to it as we would have hoped, but we certanely enjoyed it so far and we hope we will continue doing it. We aim to create fun games for everyone to enjoy and we would be more than happy to recieve any feedback regarding anything about us. For now, we graduatly release the progress we've done on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLutmfxG3yLYkZVwdt_eXpg?">YouTube channel</a>, so you can go check the videos if you are interested in what we have done so far.</p>

                Backstory
            </h1>
            <p>Aqualood was created in early 2020 as a way for a group of 9th graders to challenge themselves during the pandemic. We have always been passionate about games and our lead developer has been developing games since he was in 6th grade. After coming up with the name and logo for Aqualood, we did a basic division of labor and got to work on our first game, TAG: The Adventurous Goat. Our lack of experience with a project of this scope said its word, as TAG was in development for around 16 months and lacked the polish you would expect in a modern game. After TAG, we took a break before deciding to start working on a sequal to a fun game a few of our members worked on during a game jam, thus creating Holey Castle 2. Unfortunately, due to school we have not been able to finish this project.</p>

            <p>These are the 3 games Aqualood has officially worked on. The former 2 are finished and can be played, while the last one exists only as a test build and development is currently suspended for an undetermined period of time.</p>
